# 🚀 React Project Setup with Vite

This repository provides a quick-start guide to setting up a modern React project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and lightweight build tool.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to scaffold and run your React application:

### 1. Create the Project

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

This command initializes a new React project named `my-react-app` using Vite's React template.

### 2. Navigate into the Project Directory

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required packages listed in `package.json`.

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default. Open it in your browser to see your React app in action!
